# CAuSE Project Repository

This repository contains the boilerplate code for the **CAuSE (Causal Approach for Explaining Multimodal Classifiers)** project. The code here is a work in progress and will be reorganized and cleaned up for future versions.

## Files

- **`e_snli_ve_CAuSE.py`**:  
  This script includes the implementation of the CAuSE framework for the **e-SNLI-VE dataset**, which focuses on visual entailment. It provides explanations for multimodal classifiers trained on this dataset using causal reasoning techniques.

- **`hateful_meme_CAuSE.py`**:  
  This script implements the CAuSE framework for the **Hateful Memes dataset**, applying causal approaches to explain multimodal classification in the context of detecting hateful content.

## Notes

- The code in this repository is the **initial consolidated version** and may still contain redundant sections, formatting issues, or comments meant for debugging. A cleaner and more modular version will be available in future updates.

## Future Updates

1. **Code Cleanup**: 
   We plan to refactor the code to improve clarity and modularity, making it easier to extend and maintain.
   
2. **Reorganization**:
   The repository structure will be updated to include more logical organization of files, utilities, and documentation.

## How to Run

For now, the scripts can be run individually by executing them in your Python environment. Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed as listed in `requirements.txt` (to be added in future updates).

## Acknowledgements

The development of this code is part of the larger CAuSE framework aimed at enhancing the interpretability of multimodal classifiers using causal reasoning.
